                        “My quietness and introverted nature is a consequence of my deeply entrenched nihilism.
                        I don’t believe there is any real value in my or anyone else’s speaking,
                        and I think that all of human existence is fundamentally insignificant.”

                        Hence, Everything about this world displeases me;
                        but, above all, my displeasure in everything displeases me,
                        but I find comfort in good fiction and music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've read numerous Books, Comics/VisualNovels, Manga/Manhwa/Manhua; watched thousands of movies,
                        anime.
                        I can't in good conscience pick just 10 of my favourite of anything from within numerous genres
                        that
                        exists in these fields.
                        It's hard for me because I can never compare things from two different genres and give a
                        definite rating.
                        I have a few favourite genres and I'll pick 5-10 favourite from each of these genres.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't want to be but sometimes I can be very critical how I judge my favourites,
                        but at the end of the day it's just my opinion so don't feel bad or sad if you disagree.

                    <legend>How I Judge good writing</legend>
                    <p><strong>1. Coherent and Cohesive Logic:</strong><br>
                        No matter how fantastical and absurd a fictional world is, it has to all make sense together.
                        The world doesn’t have to be anything like our world, but it has to have clarity. All the pieces
                        must fit together in a logical fashion. If any one part of it sticks out and feels odd that's a
                        RED flag in my book.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Cause and Effect:</strong><br>
                        Writers spend a considerable amount of time developing the motives of the characters. But what
                        about the motives of the world? Taking the time to consider the societal and political motives
                        and how they impact the characters’ lives can add a considerable amount of depth and realism to
                        a story. It’s also a great way to develop a great theme for a story.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Strategic Details/Worldbuilding:</strong><br>
                        Worldbuilding can involve developing and writing down a considerable amount of backstory and
                        history to the location and characters in the story. Some of this information will be important
                        to share with the reader, but a lot of it is only important to the author. One of your greatest
                        challenges is figuring out which details are important for the readers to know and which are
                        not. It’s also important to know when to introduce the details. Starting a novel with a lot of
                        info dump is a bad idea. The reader doesn’t need to know everything within the opening pages.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>4. Mystery:</strong><br>
                        Mystery is closely related to worldbuilding. By not telling the reader everything and creating
                        intrigue in how you introduce information is a great way to create lifelong fans. A sense of
                        discovery and giving readers an opportunity to speculate and theorize what may be coming next is
                        ideal. New worlds should be left for discovery, not dumped on us like a history book.</p>

                    <p><strong>5. Depth and Width:</strong><br>
                        One of the reasons I love fantasies so much is because of their close connection to the natural
                        world. Describing the views of nature is a part of writing I love the most. But it’s not enough
                        to only describe what the eye can see. Be sure to play with all the senses: sight, smell, sound,
                        taste, and touch. Doing so will create considerable depth to the story and really draw the
                        reader in.</p>

                    <p><strong>6. Mirrors our real world with deviations:</strong><br>
                        Let’s face it, we are drawn to the familiar. No matter how fantastical a world becomes, adding
                        even the most minor elements of familiarity engage readers. Often without them even realizing
                        it. Mirroring our real world to varying degrees is not only intriguing but desired.</p>

                    <p><strong>7. Complexity:</strong><br>
                        The degree of complexity needed for a world will be heavily influenced by the plot and overall
                        story the writer wants to tell. If he's embarking on the journey of creating the next best epic
                        fantasy, complexity is a must. Just as our world is, your world should also be complex.
                        Considering elements such as culture (multicultural), religions, societal divisions, economy,
                        etc. add a higher sense of believability to the world. Simplicity has its place, but not always
                        where worldbuilding is concerned.</p>
